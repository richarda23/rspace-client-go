## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome, as the client does not yet fully cover the RSpace API, especially

 - sharing
 - form creation
 - export

 Please submit any contributions as pull requests. 

 If you would like to contribute, please ask us about getting free access to a Docker instance of RSpace to test your code against. Please read [our Docker setup guide](https://researchspace.helpdocs.io/article/aj63kmb3uh-running-rspace-on-docker)
